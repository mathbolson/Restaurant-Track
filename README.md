  ## Description:
  So the ideia of this project was based so companies could use this app so their employees can have a network where they can get to know each other based on their food taste.  This application allows people to evaluate restaurants but don’t stop there.. For example you wanna go to your favorite sushi place but you don’t know who to invite? We got you covered. Wanna know something about a new restaurant? You can check out and see If one of your colleagues have reviewed it. Some people that are vegan can connect with other vegans and go to their favorite places together. 
  ## Installation:
  It's deployed to Heroku so You can just acces this link. But to install this application you can Unzip this folder to your computer. Then in your terminal type in "npm install" to install all dependencies. On your Mysql Workbench create a schema called "restaurants_db". Then you can run the app typing in "node server" you can have access on your localhost8080 page.
  ## Usage:
  You can review restaurants. Data will be stored. Then you can access all reviews in the "keep track of your reviews" page. Also you can find all the people that reviewed a specific restaurant that you would like to go.
