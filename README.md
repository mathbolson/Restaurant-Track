  ## Description:
  So the ideia of this project was based so companies could use this app so their employees can have a network where they can get to know each other based on their food taste.  This application allows people to evaluate restaurants but don’t stop there.. For example you wanna go to your favorite sushi place but you don’t know who to invite? We got you covered. Wanna know something about a new restaurant? You can check out and see If one of your colleagues have reviewed it. Some people that are vegan can connect with other vegans and go to their favorite places together. 
  ## Installation:
